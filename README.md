# drain-cpp
A c++ implementation of Drain3 (https://github.com/IBM/Drain3) 

Please compile with -std=c++2a because i made wide use of modern standard language, or alternatively you can change the source code to not use that flag, couldn't care less. 


This is an exercise in futility, there is better code maintained by more experienced developers that does the same stuff this one does, but tidier. 
Seriously, go check the IBM repository for Drain3.
